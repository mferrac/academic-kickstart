An Agricultural Engineer turned data scientist by crop yield modeling.
I started using machine learning to study the effects of spatial autocorrelation in empirical modeling of sugarcane yield, coffee disease occurrence prediction and soil classification models.
Outside of agriculture, I have developed projects on fraud detection, lawsuit outcome prediction, customer churning, logistics transportation, car GPS tracking, students performance on online education and survey data analysis.
